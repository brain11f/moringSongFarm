			<p>Morningsong Farm, nestled among multi generational dairy farms, is part of the beautiful Stillaguamish farm district in Northwest Washington. Our 24 acre farm is a family run operation and we love caring for our huge flock of free range chickens, pastured cows and happy pigs but our true passion is in growing and arranging flowers. Morningsong is primarily a cut flower farm focusing on seasonal and sustainably grown blooms. </p>

			<h3>Weddings and Events</h3>
			<p>We love working together as a family, enjoying the beauty of nature and live our lives based on the seasons that act as our guide. In the spring our fields come to life with delicate, fragrant, and beautiful flowers such as specialty tulips, old fashioned narcissus, lilacs, billowy peonies and intoxicating sweet peas. We harvest anemones, poppies and ranunculus that we have cared for all winter. The summer is a busy and prolific time of beautiful flowers and foliage. The flower fields are bursting with color. There are fruited branches, cheerful zinnias, stunning dahlias and elegant roses. The fall and winter are all about texture with interesting foliage, colorful branches as well as interesting seed pods and berries.</p>
